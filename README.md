# PES DATABASE

Purely a personal labour of love, this project will result in a searchable, stable 'movie database'-style encyclopaedia of PES (Pro Evolution Soccer) from its inception as Goal Storm/ISS on the PS1 in the mid-1990s, through all the years of PES itself, up to the current incarnation as eFootball 2022.
